# Meeting Notes

- MRIs done by GE
- fast active imaging
- angiogram enhances likelihood of seeing dilated vessel
- males a little bit younger than females 45-50, females about 5-10 years older
- Certain kidney diseases
- Certain markers in the body that suggest vessels have been stretched
- False positives - if too many frames show an aneurysm
- Identify a patient as at high risk if multiple frames show a high likelihood
- Maybe get an aneurysm check or so
